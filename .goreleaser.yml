      The `tfselect` command line tool lets you select version of terraform(https://www.terraform.io/).
      If you do not have a particular version of terraform installed, `tfselect` will download the version you desire.
      The installation is minimal and easy.
      Once installed, simply select the version you require from the dropdown and start using terraform.
